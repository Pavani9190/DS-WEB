  <em>Repository with projects and practices that reflect my evolution as a web developer in the Systems Development technical course.</em>
</p>

## 🧠 About the Repository

This repository is a **practical portfolio** of the activities I developed throughout the course. Here you will find real code that represents my learning with:

- 🎨 **HTML5 and CSS3** — creating layouts and responsive pages.
- 🧠 **JavaScript** — programming logic, DOM manipulation, dynamic interactions.
- 🛠️ **PHP** — back-end development, database integration, and CRUD operations.
- 🗃️ **MySQL** — data manipulation and database structure.
